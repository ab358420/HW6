This is the companion site for the book “Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux” Second Edition by Derek Molloy. It is maintained by the author and it contains supporting digital downloads, video, and source code examples. The website also contains additional materials that are too specific to include in the book. Each chapter in the book links to an individual web page (e.g., /chapter1), which can be accessed using the drop-down menu on the top right-hand side of this page.
